                        One theory is that woodland pickers strung them on pieces of straw to carry them to market. 
                        Others believe that the surface of the fruit looks as if it’s embedded with bits of straw. 
                        Still others think that the name comes from the Old English word meaning “to strew,” because 
                        the plant’s runners stray in all directions and look as if they are strewn on the ground.
                        The full moon for June is called the Strawberry Moon because the Algonquin tribes knew that 
                        when they saw this full moon, it was time to start gathering ripening fruit.
