                    Bears are carnivoran mammals of the family 
                    <b>Ursidae</b>. They are classified as <class="one">caniforms</class>, or 
                    doglike <class="one">carnivorans</class>. Although only eight species of bears 
                    are extant, they are widespread, appearing in a wide variety 
                    of habitats throughout the Northern Hemisphere and partially 
                    in the Southern Hemisphere. Bears are found on the continents 
                    of North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. Common 
                    characteristics of modern bears include large bodies with stocky 
                    legs, long snouts, small rounded ears, shaggy hair, 
                    plantigrade paws with five nonretractile claws, and short tails.
